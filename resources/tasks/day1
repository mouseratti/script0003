1) Write a function that computes character frequency for a given text.
   The text to be analyzed is passed as argument, the result is returned from
   function, not displayed. Keep separate count for vowels and consonants.
   eg:
   {“vowels”:
   {“a”: 4, “e”: 2},
   “consonants”:
   {“b”: 12, “g”:1}
   }




2) Given two arrays of strings a1 and a2
return a sorted array r in lexicographical order of the strings
a1 which are substrings of strings of a2.

#Example 1:
    a1 = ["arp", "live", "strong"]
    a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]
    returns ["arp", "live", "strong"]

#Example 2:
a1 = ["tarp", "mice", "bull"]
a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]

returns []

Beware: return must be without duplicates.
Don't mutate the inputs.
